## Best Markets to Advertise in an E-learning Company
I worked on the data of e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. The survey data is publicly available in this __[GitHub repository.](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey)__ The dataset contains 18175 records and they give us information about different courses, events and bootcamps that users have participated in, country of citizenship, country they live in, employment field and status, gender, debt, number of learning hours, income, job preferences, marital status, money spent, number of programming months, sources of learning and school degree.

We want to promote our product and we want to invest some money in advertisement and the aim is to find the two best markets to advertise our product in.

### Summary of Results
The only solid conclusion we reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in. We further narrowed down our choices to advertise between Canada and India. There are good chances that India might actually be a better choice because of the large number of potential customers.

We can choose one of the below options:

1. Advertise in the US, India, and Canada by splitting the advertisement budget in various combinations:
  - 60% for the US, 25% for India, 15% for Canada.
  - 50% for the US, 30% for India, 20% for Canada; etc.
  - Advertise only in the US and India, or the US and Canada.
2. Again, it makes sense to split the advertisement budget unequally. For instance:
  - 70% for the US, and 30% for India.
  - 65% for the US, and 35% for Canada; etc.
3. Advertise only in the US.
