    "## Best Markets to Advertise in an E-learning Company\n",
    "We are working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. The survey data is publicly available in this __[GitHub repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey)__. Out dataset contains 18175 records and they give us information about different courses, events and bootcamps that users have participated in, country of citizenship, country they live in, employment field and status, gender, debt, number of learning hours, income, job preferences, marital status, money spent, number of programming months, sources of learning and school degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to promote our product and we want to invest some money in advertisement. Our aim is to find the two best markets to advertise our product in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Results\n",
    " The only solid conclusion we reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in. We further narrowed down our choices to advertise between Canada and India. There are good chances that India might actually be a better choice because of the large number of potential customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can choose one of the below options:\n",
    "1. Advertise in the US, India, and Canada by splitting the advertisement budget in various combinations:\n",
    "    - 60% for the US, 25% for India, 15% for Canada.\n",
    "    - 50% for the US, 30% for India, 20% for Canada; etc.\n",
    "    - Advertise only in the US and India, or the US and Canada. \n",
    "2. Again, it makes sense to split the advertisement budget unequally. For instance:\n",
    "    - 70% for the US, and 30% for India.\n",
    "    - 65% for the US, and 35% for Canada; etc.\n",
    "3. Advertise only in the US."

    "### Understanding the Data\n",
    "To avoid spending money on organizing a survey, we'll first try to make use of existing data to determine whether we can reach any reliable result.\n",
    "\n",
    "One good candidate for our purpose is __[freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969)__ __[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)__ is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run __[a popular Medium publication](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/)__ (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis.\n",

Below, we'll do a quick exploration of the 2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv file stored in the clean-data folder of the repository we just mentioned.

The JobRoleInterest column describes for every participant the role(s) they'd be interested in working in. If a participant is interested in working in a certain domain, it means that they're also interested in learning about that domain. So let's take a look at the frequency distribution table of this column and determine whether the data we have is relevant."

    "Let's start with creating a new column that describes the amount of money a student has spent per month so far. To do that, we'll need to divide the MoneyForLearning column to the MonthsProgramming column. The problem is that some students answered that they have been learning to code for 0 months (it might be that they have just started). To avoid dividing by 0, we'll replace 0 with 1 in the MonthsProgramming column."

    "### Choosing the Two Best Markets\n",
    "Obviously, one country we should advertise in is the US. Lots of new coders live there and they are willing to pay a good amount of money each month (roughly 143 dollars).\n",
    "\n",
    "We sell subscriptions at a price of 59 dollars per month, and Canada seems to be the best second choice because people there are willing to pay roughly 93 dollars per month, compared to India (66 dollars) and the United Kingdom (45 dollars).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data suggests strongly that we shouldn't advertise in the UK, but let's take a second look at India before deciding to choose Canada as our second best choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 59 dollars doesn't seem like an expensive sum for people in India since they spend on average 66 dollars each month.\n",
    "2. We have almost twice as more potential customers in India than we have in Canada:"

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, we analyzed survey data from new coders to find the best two markets to advertise in. The only solid conclusion we reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in. It is not crystal clear what to choose between Canada and India. There are good chances that India might actually be a better choice because of the large number of potential customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can choose one of the below options:\n",
    "1. Advertise in the US, India, and Canada by splitting the advertisement budget in various combinations:\n",
    "    - 60% for the US, 25% for India, 15% for Canada.\n",
    "    - 50% for the US, 30% for India, 20% for Canada; etc.\n",
    "    - Advertise only in the US and India, or the US and Canada. \n",
    "2. Again, it makes sense to split the advertisement budget unequally. For instance:\n",
    "    - 70% for the US, and 30% for India.\n",
    "    - 65% for the US, and 35% for Canada; etc.\n",
    "3. Advertise only in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it's probably best to send our analysis to the marketing team and let them use their domain knowledge to decide. They might want to do some extra surveys in India and Canada and then get back to us for analyzing the new survey data."
